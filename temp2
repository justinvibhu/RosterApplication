Dear Team,We are currently in the process of migrating the AdminLookup service, specifically the getFormDocumentDetails and searchFormDocumentDetails functions, from the EIP to the new Quadient eForms platform. This service is utilized by both the MetOnline and GSSP applications via the EIP in our earlier legacy system. The same service will continue to be utilized by GSSP in the Quadient eForms system. No changes are required on the GSSP and MetOnline ends, as all necessary modifications will be implemented within Quadient eForms.To ensure a successful migration and verify that all functionalities are working as expected, we will need testing support from both the GSSP and MetOnline teams. Your cooperation and assistance in testing will be crucial for a smooth transition.Please let us know your availability for testing and any additional support you might require during this process.




Hi DMF Team,

As discussed in our recent call, we are working on a service from the consumer application to Quadient Eforms. We have noticed that the 'content size' field (the PDF size) is missing in the data retrieved from FileNet via the DMF API service.

I have previously discussed this with Sachin Rawat, and he mentioned that this field is not currently integrated into the DMF API service call, which is why we cannot retrieve the 'content size' metadata in our response. This field is essential for us to generate the response for the consumer application eform.

We kindly request that you prioritize the implementation or integration of this field with the DMF API service, so we can proceed with the implementation on our side.

I've attached a screenshot for your reference.

Subject: Missing 'Content Size' Field in DMF Service Call

Hi Rupesh,

While working on one of the MetOnline functionalities, specifically the searchFromDocument service call to Quadient Eforms, we noticed that the 'content size' field (the PDF size) is missing in the data retrieved from FileNet via the DMF API service.

I discussed this with Sachin Rawat from DMF, and he mentioned that this field isn't integrated into the DMF API service call, which is why we can't get the 'content size' metadata in our response. We need to discuss this with the DMF onshore lead, Lauon, to integrate this field into the existing service.

I've attached a screenshot for your reference.

# Load Excel file
df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')  # Adjust filename and sheetname if needed

# Group and process
grouped = df.groupby('OID')['CustID'].apply(lambda x: ','.join(map(str, x))).reset_index()
grouped.columns = ['OID', 'CustIDs']

# Save result to Excel
grouped.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)
